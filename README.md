#PHASE-1-JAVASCRIPT-PROJECT Crazy Quote Battle Royale!
Intialization:
In order to see our app and play it first we need to intialize our server with
npm install -g json-server
json-server --watch db.json
It is imporatnt to complete this step in order to pull from the API we created with the quotes from both Trump and Kayne.
After this is complete be sure to open up the HTML file in a web browser.


Overview:
Welcome to our project that was accomplished with 3 weeks of knowledge while at Flatiron school. Our goal was to create and design a website app that would display the functionality of event listeners, create an HTML document, use CSS to style our webpage and include some interactivity in our website. 

The first hurdle was creating a website in HTML that we would be able to style with CSS. Starting javascript in our first three weeks lead to little to no experience in HTML. The due date for our project was in 1 weeks time. During this my partner and I became more familiar with HTML through practice and google searches. It was through our own research that we were able to produce an HTML with our unique styling. Once the HTML was operable my partner and I decided to split the work in terms of HTML/Styling and the other working on the JavaScript. If either one of us had questions or needed help that would be provided. 

The second hurlde is where our group struggled the most and this was integrating and using external APIs. Since our project was centered around randomness of generating a quote from two APIs we were unsure of how to accomplish this goal. Eventually through enough trial and error and google searches, we were able to pull from both APIs and generate random quotes from both.

Our third hurdle was easily accomplished with adding event listeners to the buttons we created in HTML. With each button click it generates a new quote, adds to the score, and pops up an alert indicating that the answer is correct or incorrect.

The interactivity in our app is self-explanatory. You play a game by making a guess towards who tweeted this specific quote on the website. After making a guess a new quote will appear and you may continue playing to better your score. 

We plan on continuing our research and knowledge of event listeners, creating an HTML document, using CSS to style our webpage and including interactivity to build bigger and better projects.

Learning Goals:
Design and architect features across a frontend
Communicate and collaborate in a technical environment
Integrate JavaScript and an external API
Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
Build and iterate on a project MVP (Minimal Viable Project)

Stretch Goals:
Integrating sound clips into our app.
Be able to click specifically on the backgorund of Trump or Kanye to a new event.
Add a scoreboard or high-score list.
Add some animation to our app
To make a timer to see who could get the highest score in the shortest amount of time.
